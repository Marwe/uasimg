\arguments{
\item{img_dirs}{Directory(s) where the image files reside}

\item{exiftool}{The path to the exiftool command line tool (omit if on the OS path)}

\item{csv}{The file name of a new csv file where the exif data will be saved (omit to make a temp one)}

\item{alt_agl}{The elevation above ground level in meters (optional for images with the relevative altitude saved)}

\item{fwd_overlap}{Whether or not to compute the amount of overlap between one image and the next, T/F}

\item{cameras}{Location of the cameras.csv file. Is NULL the package csv file will be used.}

\item{metadata}{A list of additional meta data (see Details)}

\item{cache}{Logical or a directory where EXIF data should be cached (see Details)}

\item{update_cache}{Whether to update the cache}

\item{quiet}{Don't show messages}
}
\value{
A named list with elements including the image centroids (as a sf data frame), footprints, total area,
minimum convex polygon, total directory size, the data flown, and extra meta data.

\description{
Extracts info from geotagged images taken from a drone
}
\details{
This will read the EXIF header data from a directory of image files, and put out the centroids and image footprints on the ground. Mapping  image locations requires that the images have geostamps. In addition, mapping the image footprints requires that the camera parameters are known, and the flight elevation about ground level is either saved in the EXIF info, or provided in the \code{alt_agl} argument (in meters). If \code{alt_agl} is passed, it will override any elevation data in the EXIF info.

Camera parameters are saved in a csv file called cameras.csv. To see where this is saved, type \code{system.file("cameras/cameras.csv", package="uasimg")}. If your camera is not detected, please contact the package author or create an issue on \href{https://github.com/UCANR-IGIS/uasimg/issues}{GitHub}.

This function uses a free command line tool called EXIFtool to read the EXIF data, which can be downloaded
from \url{http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/}.  After you download it, rename the executable file,
'exiftool(-k).exe' to 'exiftool.exe', and save it somewhere on your system's PATH (e.g., c:\\Windows).

\code{metadata} is an optional named list containing additional metadata field. Supported list elements include
\code{collection_name}, \code{data_url}, \code{description}, \code{contact}, and \code{pilot}.

If \code{metadata} is not passed, an alternative way to pass these additional metadata
fields is to put them in a text file called 'metadata.txt' in the same directory as the images. The structure of the
text file should be YAML, in other words a key:value pair on each line (no delimiters). For example:

\code{collection_name: Hopland Research and Extension Center, Watershed II
data_url: https://ucdavis.box.com/s/dp0sdfssxxxxxsdf
description: These data were collected as part of a pre-restoration monitoring program}

Lines starting with a hash or forward slash will be interpreted as comments and ignored.

\code{cache} can be a logical value or the name of a directory where EXIF data gets cached.
If \code{cache = TRUE}, the default cache directory will be used (\code{~/.R}). Cached EXIF data is linked
to a directory of images based on the directory name and total size of all image files.
So if images are added or removed from the directory, the cache will be automatically rebuilt
the next time the function is run. \code{update_cache} is a logical value
which forces an update of cached data when TRUE.
